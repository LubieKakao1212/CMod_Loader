// The primary way mods modify the game is through "actions".
//
// Actions are little commands that modify the game's .rules files *after* they have been
// loaded into RAM. (The actual .rules files in the 'Data' folder are never modified
// and so disabling a mod will cause the game to revert back to its vanilla state.)
//
// First, the game loads the vanilla .rules files normally.
// Then, for every mod that is enabled, that mod's "actions" are run on
// top of the loaded .rules files, modifying them.
//
// Using this technique, mods can make almost any change to the game
// that *could* be made by modifying the .rules files directly, but
// without actually having to make any permanent changes to the game files.
//
// The examples below show all the different kinds of "actions" that can be
// performed on the vanilla .rules data.
//
// Note that it's very easy to make a modification that will cause the game
// to crash when loading. The log .txt file may have details on why it crashed.
//
// There are a small number of .rules files that can't be modified using actions.
// The most prominent example is the language string files (such as en.rules)
// which are modified using the StringsFolder setting above.
